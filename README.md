Notes: After many many hours of trying, the API method that changes the address of a student using his/her StudentId errors due to multiple endpoints and I could not find a solution. However the rest do work and both of the PUT method works if there is only one.

I decided to not make anything Required in the Address table as everything would be required if an address is being input, otherwise there would be no point in inputting anything. The user may also only want to share partial information such as their city or suburb rather than their full address.
